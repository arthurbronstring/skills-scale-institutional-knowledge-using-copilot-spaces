# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This guide provides comprehensive information about how OctoAcme runs projects, from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative approach to project delivery that emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our project management methodology is built on five core principles: prioritizing customer value, delivering small testable increments, maintaining clear ownership with named Project Managers and Product Leads, making data-informed decisions, and encouraging feedback and learning in a safe environment. Each project flows through a structured lifecycle—from initiation where we validate business needs and align stakeholders, through planning where we break work into actionable increments, into execution where teams build and test features, through release and deployment to production, and finally into retrospectives where we capture learnings and drive continuous improvement.

Our project teams are organized around clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Project Managers coordinate delivery activities, manage schedules and risks, and facilitate cross-team communication. Product Managers define what should be built, prioritize the roadmap based on customer value, and measure success through defined metrics. Developers implement features with a focus on maintainability and test coverage, while QA and Testing specialists validate quality and acceptance criteria. Stakeholders provide critical inputs and approvals throughout the project lifecycle. This clear delineation of roles ensures accountability while promoting effective collaboration across functions.

Communication and transparency are fundamental to our approach. Teams maintain a consistent rhythm with daily 15-minute standups focusing on progress and blockers, twice-weekly delivery syncs for detailed updates, weekly alignment meetings between Project Managers and Product Managers, and monthly stakeholder updates. We maintain a single source of truth for project status through project READMEs and centralized documentation. When issues arise, clear escalation paths ensure problems are addressed quickly—from team-level triage to PM coordination to Product Lead involvement, and ultimately to sponsor-level escalation for business-critical matters.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout our delivery process. We enforce rigorous standards including unit tests for all new logic, integration tests where applicable, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and automated security scanning in our CI pipelines. Pull requests follow strict conventions: keeping changes small (≤400 lines when possible), linking to issues with clear acceptance criteria, running automated tests before review, and requiring at least one approval before merging. Each project defines a clear Definition of Done, and we track velocity, burndown, and success metrics through dashboards. This disciplined approach to quality ensures we deliver reliable, secure, and maintainable solutions that meet customer needs.
