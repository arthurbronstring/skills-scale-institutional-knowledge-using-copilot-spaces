# Stakeholder Mapping Template

## Purpose
Identify and map all project stakeholders to ensure effective communication, manage expectations, and align on project goals throughout the lifecycle.

## When to Use
- During project initiation to identify all interested parties
- When onboarding new team members to understand the stakeholder landscape
- Periodically throughout the project to update engagement needs

## Stakeholder Matrix

### Internal Stakeholders

| Example: Jane Doe | Engineering | High - Tech Lead | High | Weekly | Project Manager | Technical decision maker |
| Example: John Smith | Product | High - Owns Roadmap | High | Daily | Product Manager | Approves scope changes |

### External Stakeholders

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Power-Interest Grid

Place stakeholders in the appropriate quadrant:

**High Power, High Interest (Manage Closely)**
- List stakeholders here who need frequent updates and active engagement

**High Power, Low Interest (Keep Satisfied)**
- List stakeholders here who need high-level updates

**Low Power, High Interest (Keep Informed)**
- List stakeholders here who want regular updates but don't make decisions

**Low Power, Low Interest (Monitor)**
- List stakeholders here who need minimal communication

## Communication Plan

### Regular Updates

| Stakeholder Group | Format | Frequency | Owner | Content Focus |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Executive Sponsors | Email Summary | Monthly | Project Manager | High-level progress, risks, decisions needed |
| Product Team | Sprint Demo | Bi-weekly | Product Manager | Feature demos, backlog updates |
| Engineering Team | Standup | Daily | Scrum Master | Daily progress, blockers |
| Business Stakeholders | Status Report | Weekly | Business Analyst | Requirements status, business impact |
