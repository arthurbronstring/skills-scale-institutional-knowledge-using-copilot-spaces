# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (facilitated by Project Manager and/or Scrum Master)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (led by Product Manager with Business Analyst support)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points - Developers with Scrum Master facilitation)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) (collaborative across Developers, QA Automation Engineers, and Product Manager)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (Project Manager with input from all technical roles)
6. Create release plan and milestone map (Project Manager with Product Manager)
